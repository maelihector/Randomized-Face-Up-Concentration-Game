# Concentration-game

## What is this?

  Concentration-Game is a memory game built using React.

  The application's UI is broken into components for efficient management of component state and response to user events.

## What does it do?
 
The application renders a dozen different images of galaxies from the [NASA](https://nasasearch.nasa.gov/search/images?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=nasa&query=galaxies) website to the screen.

The objective of the game is to click on all 12 images once to win. However, each time the user clicks on an image, the images are shuffled.

The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time, their score is incremented.

If the user clicks on an image they have already clicked on, their score is reset to 0 and the game starts over.

The application keeps track of the users Top Score and updates their Top Score when the user achieves a new Top Score.

The application also keeps track of the user's Number of Tries before winning a game. When the user has won a game, the application encourages the user to challange themselves by trying to win the next game with fewer Number of Tries.
